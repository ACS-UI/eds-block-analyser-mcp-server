Use WebResearch tools to scrape URLs and discover ALL sub-pages comprehensively, then map components to Adobe's EDS block collection for accurate effort estimation and pattern matching.
 
## Tool Integration
 
### Block Collection Tools for EDS Block Mapping
Use the following tools to access Adobe's EDS (Experience Design System) block collection:
 
1. **fetch_aem_block_docs** - Fetch complete documentation from Adobe's AEM block collection repository
2. **search_aem_block_docs** - Search within the fetched documentation for specific EDS block patterns
3. **search_aem_block_code** - Search for code examples and implementations within the block collection
4. **fetch_generic_url_content** - Fetch content from any absolute URL for additional analysis
 
### WebResearch Integration for Web Scraping
Use WebResearch tools for comprehensive web scraping and URL discovery:
 
1. **search_google** - Search for relevant URLs and content across the web.
2. **visit_page** - Scrape individual URLs to extract content, metadata, and discover sub-URLs.
3. **take_screenshot** - Capture visual representations of pages for design analysis.
 
**Important**: WebResearch tools provide comprehensive web scraping capabilities. ALL sub-pages must be crawled and analyzed to ensure complete coverage.
 
### Tool Usage Workflow, step by step:
1. **Planning Phase**: Use the website_analysis_planner tool to orchestrate the complete analysis workflow
2. **Initial Analysis**: Use WebResearch to scrape ALL URLs and discover ALL sub-URLs and add to site-urls artifact.
3. **Comprehensive URL Discovery**: Ensure ALL sub-pages are discovered and added to the analysis scope
4. **Complete Content Extraction**: Extract all relevant content, components, and design patterns from each URL
5. **URL Statistics Tracking**: For each URL, record processing status, component count, complexity distribution, and template classification
6. **EDS Block Mapping**: Use Block Collection tools to map discovered components to existing EDS blocks, ignore the repeated pages and templates.
7. **Block Variation Analysis**: Use the block_variation_analyzer tool to group similar blocks into variations and apply appropriate naming conventions.
8. **Effort Estimation**: Analyze complexity and estimate effort for each component based on EDS patterns using S-Simple, M-Medium, C-Complex sizing
9. **Output Generation**: Create comprehensive analysis with CSV, summary (including URL analysis section), and evaluation artifacts

### MANDATORY URL Analysis Validation Protocol
**CRITICAL**: You MUST follow this protocol to ensure 100% URL coverage:

1. **URL Discovery Phase**:
   - Start with the provided domain URL
   - Use visit_page to discover ALL internal links and sub-URLs
   - Follow ALL navigation links, footer links, and sitemap links
   - Document EVERY discovered URL in the site-urls artifact
   - Continue crawling until NO new URLs are discovered

2. **URL Processing Verification**:
   - Create a comprehensive list of ALL discovered URLs
   - Process EVERY URL in the list without exception
   - Track processing status for each URL (visited/processed/analyzed)
   - Verify that component extraction is performed for each URL
   - Ensure no URL is skipped or missed

3. **Coverage Validation**:
   - Cross-reference discovered URLs with processed URLs
   - Verify that the count of discovered URLs matches processed URLs
   - Confirm that all navigation levels are covered (1st, 2nd, 3rd level and beyond)
   - Validate that all page templates are represented
   - Ensure all content types are included

4. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Document any inaccessible URLs with reasons
   - Verify that component analysis is complete for each accessible URL
   - Ensure visual analysis (screenshots) is captured for each URL
   - Validate that all UI components are identified and mapped
 
### Comprehensive URL Discovery Strategy
**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE**:

1. **Complete Site Crawling**: 
   - Discover and analyze ALL sub-pages within the target website
   - Use systematic crawling approach to ensure no page is missed
   - Follow ALL internal links recursively until exhaustion

2. **Template Diversity**: 
   - Ensure coverage of all different page templates (home, product, contact, etc.)
   - Identify and analyze at least one instance of each unique template
   - Document template variations and their URLs

3. **Component Coverage**: 
   - Include pages with all UI component types present on the site
   - Ensure every component type is represented in the analysis
   - Map components across different page contexts

4. **Navigation Depth**: 
   - Cover URLs from all navigation levels (1st, 2nd, 3rd level pages and beyond)
   - Follow breadcrumb navigation to discover deep pages
   - Ensure no navigation path is left unexplored

5. **Content Types**: 
   - Include all static pages, dynamic content, and interactive elements
   - Analyze pages with different content structures
   - Ensure all content variations are captured

6. **Responsive Patterns**: 
   - Analyze pages that demonstrate different responsive behaviors
   - Capture mobile and desktop variations where applicable

7. **URL Tracking and Validation**:
   - Maintain a master list of ALL discovered URLs
   - Track processing status for each URL
   - Validate that processing count matches discovery count
   - Document any URLs that cannot be accessed with reasons
 
### Complete Processing Protocol
**MANDATORY STEPS FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS**:

1. **URL Discovery and Documentation**:
   - Discover ALL URLs starting from the provided domain
   - Create a master URL list with metadata (page type, navigation level, accessibility)
   - Document EVERY discovered URL in the site-urls artifact
   - Continue discovery until no new URLs are found

2. **URL Processing Verification**:
   - Process EVERY URL from the master list without exception
   - Track processing status: [discovered] → [visited] → [analyzed] → [components extracted]
   - Verify that each URL has been fully processed before moving to the next
   - Maintain a processing log to ensure no URL is missed

3. **Full Site Analysis**: 
   - Process ALL discovered URLs to ensure comprehensive coverage
   - Extract components from EVERY accessible URL
   - Document any inaccessible URLs with reasons and alternative approaches

4. **Template Identification**: 
   - Identify and analyze all distinct page templates
   - Ensure each template type is represented in the analysis
   - Map URLs to their corresponding templates

5. **Component Mapping**: 
   - Map all components across the entire site
   - Ensure components are extracted from ALL processed URLs
   - Cross-reference components across different pages and templates

6. **Cross-Reference**: 
   - Ensure analysis covers all aspects of the website
   - Validate that all discovered URLs have corresponding component analysis
   - Verify completeness of the analysis against the master URL list

7. **Consolidation**: 
   - Merge results from all pages into unified analysis output
   - Ensure the final output reflects analysis of ALL discovered URLs
   - Validate that no URLs were skipped or missed in the process

8. **Final Validation**:
   - Cross-reference the master URL list with processed URLs
   - Verify that processing count equals discovery count
   - Confirm that all accessible URLs have complete component analysis
   - Document any gaps or missing data with explanations

## Technical Definitions
 
### UI Block Requirements
A **block** is a **reusable, independent UI unit** with:
- Its own folder under 'blocks/' (e.g., 'blocks/hero-banner/', 'blocks/footer/')
- Self-contained CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files
- Clear input/output interfaces
- Responsive design considerations
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization
 
### Component Complexity Levels
- **XS (1-2 days)**: Simple static components (buttons, labels, basic text)
- **S (3-5 days)**: Interactive components with basic state (forms, modals, navigation)
- **M (1-2 weeks)**: Complex components with multiple states (carousels, data tables, multi-step forms)
- **L (2-4 weeks)**: Advanced components with complex interactions (dashboards, real-time updates, complex animations)
- **XL (1+ months)**: System-level components requiring architectural decisions (authentication systems, complex workflows)
